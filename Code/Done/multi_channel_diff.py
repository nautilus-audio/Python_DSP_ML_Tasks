'''
A)
Differences in correlation

B) 
Channel Count Mismatch:

Comparing two multi-channel audio files with different numbers of channels (e.g., 5.1 vs. 7.1) leads to misalignment issues.
Solution: Extract and compare corresponding channels (e.g., L & R vs. L & R).
Spatial Information & Panning:

Multi-channel audio has spatialized elements (e.g., background sounds in surround speakers).
Stereo audio collapses spatial data, making it difficult to compare spatial positioning.

Phase and Delay Differences:

Surround mixes often introduce delays between channels to create spatial depth.
This can make cross-correlation alignment difficult since one channel may be offset slightly.

LFE (Low-Frequency Effects) Channel Issues:

Some multi-channel formats contain an LFE (Subwoofer) channel, which does not directly correlate with other channels.
If included in similarity calculations, it may skew results.

C)
Different Mixing Strategies:

A stereo downmix might be derived from a 5.1 mix, but it wonâ€™t contain the same spatial characteristics.
Sample Rate Mismatches:

If files have different sample rates, librosa.load(sr=None) ensures they retain native rates, but mismatches may still cause drift over time.
Channel Reordering:

Some multi-channel formats have different channel orders (e.g., WAV vs. AAC). If channels are misaligned, similarity scores will be inaccurate.
Compression & Encoding Differences:

Lossy formats like MP3 or AAC may introduce artifacts that alter the waveform.
