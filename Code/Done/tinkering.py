Tinkering Around:
1, ) I would use headtracking and channel isoalation features of Apple Music to get a better feel 
for the space it was mixed in. I would comapre the spatial mix to its stereo counterpart for panninng and gain. I would then (not sure if this is a feature) try to export the 
spatial mix so that I could anaylze it with visual tools in Logic. I would use a spatial analyzer, 
as well as a multi-channel audio monitoring. 

2) I would use the same tools as above, but I would also use a multi-channel audio monitoring system
to get a better feel for the space.

3) To be honest, I am an avid musician and music producer. I would most likely research the 
producers and their music with that information. I would also try to create something in the same style 
if I enjoyed the tracks.
